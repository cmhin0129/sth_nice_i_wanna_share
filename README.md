Hey guys, I am @0.5mins, a final year math student in HK (who is surrendered to pure math and transitioning to statistics). I am currently working on composing my own "ultimate" notes on basic combinatorics and mathematical statistics, and I am excited to share them with my mates. Hope you will enjoy it too!

If you find any mistakes or something I can improve on, feel free to leave me a message on the discussion board!

## Currently published:

#### Book 1 - Basic combinatorics

Section 1. Introduction to combinatorics

## In progress:

#### Book 1 - Basic combinatorics

Section 2. Recurrence relations and generating functions (almost done)

Section 3. Introduction to graph theory (halfway I guess?)

#### Book 2 - Probability and statistics

Section 5. Introduction to probability theory (just began)

## Planning:

#### Book 1 - Basic combinatorics

Section 4. Introduction to linear programming

#### Book 2 - Probability and statistics

Section 6. Introduction to mathematical statistics

Section 7. Measure-theoretic probability

More topics coming soon, but most of them will be on statistics, probably on stochastic calculus, statistical inference or something like that.

### Shout out to my girlfriend, a sweet princess who always supports me unconditionally, and my Threads-mate @lkc_09.26 for motivating me to initiate this project.
