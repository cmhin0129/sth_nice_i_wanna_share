Hey guys, I am @0.5mins, a final year math student in HK (who is surrendered to pure math and transitioning to statistics). I am currently working on composing my own "ultimate" notes that collect the things I learnt, and I am excited to share them with my mates. Hope you will enjoy it too!

If you find any mistakes or something I can improve on, feel free to leave me a message on the discussion board!

## Currently published:

Notes 0B - Basic Combinatorics

## Preparing:

Notes 0A - Quantitative Methods
Notes 1 - Introductory Probability and Statistics

## Planning:

Notes 0C - Programming

More topics coming soon, but most of them will be on statistics, probably on stochastic calculus, statistical inference or something like that.

### Shout out to my girlfriend, a sweet princess who always supports me unconditionally, and my Threads-mate @lkc_09.26 for motivating me to initiate this project.
