Hey guys, I am @0.5mins, a final year math student in HK (who is surrendered to pure math and transitioning to statistics). I am currently working on composing my own "ultimate" notes that collect the things I learnt, and I am excited to share them with my mates. Hope you will enjoy it too!

If you find any mistakes or something I can improve on, feel free to leave me a message on the discussion board!

Shout out to my girlfriend, a sweet princess who always supports me unconditionally, and my Threads-mate @lkc_09.26 for motivating me to initiate this project.
